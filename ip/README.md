# BuddyBot project template

BuddyBot is a simple task management chatbot that helps you keep track of your to-dos, deadlines, and events.

## Getting Started

1. Run BuddyBot using the command:
   ```
   java -jar BuddyBot.jar
   ```
If you are using IntelliJ, you can also run it by clicking the Run button.

2. Use commands to add, view, and manage your tasks

3. Tasks are automatically saved between sessions

## Available Commands

| `deadline` | `deadline TASK_DESCRIPTION /by DEADLINE` | `deadline return book /by June 6th` | Adds a task with a deadline |
| `event` | `event TASK_DESCRIPTION /from START_TIME /to END_TIME` | `event team meeting /from Monday 2pm /to Monday 4pm` | Adds an event with start and end times |

### Managing Tasks

| Command | Format | Example | Description |
|---------|--------|---------|-------------|
| `list` | `list` | `list` | Shows all tasks |
| `mark` | `mark TASK_NUMBER` | `mark 3` | Marks a task as done |

## Task Formats

Tasks are displayed in the following format:

- **To-Do**: `[T][✓] read book` (✓ means done, ✗ means not done)
- **Deadline**: `[D][✓] return book (by: June 6th)`
- **Event**: `[E][✓] team meeting (from: Monday 2pm to: Monday 4pm)`

## Examples

### Adding Different Types of Tasks

```
todo finish homework
deadline complete project /by Friday
event doctor appointment /from Tuesday 10am /to Tuesday 11am
```

### Managing Your Tasks

```
list
mark 2
unmark 3
delete 1
```

### Finding Tasks

```
find project
    ____________________________________________________________
     Here are the matching tasks in your list:
     1.[T][✗] start new project
     2.[D][✓] complete project (by: Friday)
```

## Tips

- Task numbers start from 1 (not 0)
- All commands are case-insensitive (`TODO` works the same as `todo`)
- Your tasks are automatically saved to a file for your next session
- Use specific keywords when searching to find relevant tasks more easily

## Error Messages

If you see an error message, check that you're using the correct command format:

- For deadlines, use `/by` to specify the due date
- For events, use both `/from` and `/to` to specify start and end times
- Task numbers must be valid (can't mark or delete task #5 if you only have 3 tasks)
